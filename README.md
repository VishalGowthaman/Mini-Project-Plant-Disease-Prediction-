# MINI PROJECT-PLANT DISEASE RECOGNITION USING CNN
###Aim:
This project aims to develop a CNN model that can accurately identify and classify different diseases that affect crops.
###Features of CNN:
Convolutional Layers:
  CNNs use convolutional layers to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input data. These layers apply filters to input data, enabling the detection of patterns and features.
Pooling Layers:
  Pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the input data by down-sampling, retaining the most important information. Max pooling, for example, selects the maximum value from a group of neighboring pixels, further emphasizing key features.
Fully Connected Layers:
  Fully connected layers process the high-level features extracted by the convolutional and pooling layers, enabling the model to make predictions or classifications based on the learned representations.
Activation Functions:
  Non-linear activation functions, such as ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), introduce non-linearity to the model, allowing it to learn complex relationships in the data. ReLU is commonly used in CNNs for its simplicity and effectiveness.
